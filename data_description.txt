The aim of this project is to analyze Boston housing data using your MATH534 knowledge.
The data contains n=1,460 observations collected from Boston area. Each observation contains one response (sale price) 
and eight predictors. The data is a subset of a larger dataset downloadable at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
In the end of the semester you will be asked to present your results in class. The best report writer(s) may be asked to analyze the full dataset
and participate the Kaggle competition.


Please do the following:

(1) determine which variables significantly affect housing price in Boston; 
(2) propose a suitable statistical model that describes the relationship between housing price and your selected variables;
(3) split the data to two parts (one for training, the other for testing) to examine your model;
(4) othe problems you are interested? try to address them;
(5) write a detailed presentable report.
